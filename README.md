# Multi-TSFool

**TSFool is a multi-objective gray-box attack method to craft highly-imperceptible adversarial samples for RNN-based time series classification. The Multi-TSFool method in this repository is built for multivariate time series data, which is an extended version of the basic TSFool for univariate time series data [here](https://github.com/FlaAI/TSFool).**
